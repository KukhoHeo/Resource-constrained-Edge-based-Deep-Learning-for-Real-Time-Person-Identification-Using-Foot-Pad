GitHub for "Resource-constrained Edge-based Deep Learning for Real-Time Person-Identification Using Foot-Pad."

"make_model_on_train_server" contains data, methods for creating models on the server, and optimization methods. The model is ziped because the model size is over the 10MB.

"Edge_Node" contains the code for running on edge nodes. Detailed instructions on how this code operates can be found at ubinos.org. The original Git url is "https://github.com/KukhoHeo/footpad".
